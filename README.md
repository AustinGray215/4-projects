# 4-projects
Simple text game for a project, (the project runs on if and else-if statements and has two un-used inheritor classes, it is simplistic in nature and lacks a loop that can be used to make it to where you don't need to run the code again unless you reach an end. there is also an issue where if the value selected is less than one the first option will still play because the code checks only for values greater than the max. the way this is run is by using the green play button near the top right conner of the screen in Intellij through the console.)

the mp3 player attempt was an attempt to make an mp3 player in java but I had spent to much time trying to find a way to convert a music video from YouTube to an mp3 file that I had run out of time for this project, when I had found a solution I needed to have had the file downloaded and in order to do that I need to pay for YouTube premium. The project does run through the green button near the top right corner of the screen and via the console. the project would use a while loop and if else statements.

the DND character generator project is a way for the people I play DND with to create characters without any trouble it as with all my projects is run by the run button in the top right by the button to close the tab, and is shown through the console. the int that runs the while loop starts at zero, and the while loop value for I can be altered to however many people are within the group.
