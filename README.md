# 4-projects
Simple text game for a project, (the project runs on if and else-if statements and has two un-used inheritor classes, it is simplistic in nature and lacks a loop that can be used to make it to where you don't need to run the code again unless you reach an end. there is also an issue where if the value selected is less than one the first option will still play because the code checks only for values greater than the max. the way this is run is by using the green play button near the top right conner of the screen in Intellij through the console.)
